				<blockquote>“Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality.” <address>—Warren Bennis</address></blockquote>

				<p>As the technical lead on dozens of projects in the last five years, my philosophy has been to challenge my team, build trust, and help others achieve success.</p>

				<p>To accomplish these goals, I have set an uncompromising vision based on client needs and objectives; trusted that my team would rise up to that challenge; led by example with savvy decision-making, accountability, and expertise; and taken opportunities to mentor and pair-program with my teammates.</p>

				<p>Over the last 3 years I have also become increasingly involved in the business and operations side of the agencies I have worked at. I have owned solutions from the proposal, scoping, and pricing stages, all the way to the technical vision, implementation, and successful deployment. Throughout this process, I have focused on the needs and requirements of internal and external clients, and ensured exceptional communication and cooperation standards were upheld.</p>
